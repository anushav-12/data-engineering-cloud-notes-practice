# Data Engineering - Day 1

## What is Data Engineering?
Data Engineering focuses on building systems that collect, process, and store data reliably.

## What does a Data Engineer basically do?
Data Engineers building reliable pipelines to move, clean, and store data

## Typical data pipeline
Source → Ingestion → Processing → Storage → Consumption

## Core responsibilities
- Data ingestion
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data storage
- Data availability for analytics

## Key concepts learned
- OLTP vs OLAP
- Batch vs Streaming
- Role of Python and SQL

Reflection:
I realized that many tasks I do in my current role align with data engineering responsibilities.
